    abstract = {Solid bodies roll and tumble through space. In computer
                animation, so do cameras. The rotations of these objects are best
                described using a four coordinate system, quaternions, as is
                shown in this paper. Of all quaternions, those on the unit sphere
                are most suitable for animation, but the question of how to
                construct curves on spheres has not been much explored. This
                paper gives one answer by presenting a new kind of spline curve,
                created on a sphere, suitable for smoothly in-betweening (i.e.
                interpolating) sequences of arbitrary rotations. Both theory and
                experiment show that the motion generated is smooth and natural,
                without quirks found in earlier methods.},
